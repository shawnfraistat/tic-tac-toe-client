Description:

This program allows users to play a game of tic-tac-toe against themselves or an
AI player with three different difficulty settings. Users can sign up to create
a user profile that will allow them to save and load games. Logged in users can
also customize the colors of the x and o markers.


Process:

I began by considering the assignment requirements and the API documentation.
The I began planning my initial wireframes and data structures. I created a
basic skeleton in HTML/CSS and started messing with Javascript. Then I fleshed
out features one by one. My approach to coding was mostly error-driven.
I'd do initial coding passes to implement a particular feature and then use the
console extensively to figure out what had to be changed/added to get it working
properly.

Project initial user stories:

As a user, I want to be able to click a space and have it display an X or O,
depending on whose turn it is.

As a user, I want the game to tell me when a player has won, or when the game is
tied.

As a user, I want to be able to play against myself or a computer opponent.

As a user, I'd like to be able to choose different difficulty settings for my
computer opponent.

As a user, I want to be able to see my previous games.

As a user, I want to be able to load unfinished games. This means I also want
the game to save my progress as I play.

As a user, I want to be able to keep a user profile where I can view/modify my
password/

As a user, I'd like to be able to change the color of the player marks.


Technologies Used:

This project makes use of HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and AJAX.


Unsolved Problems:

There's a bug I'd like to track down that occurs sporadically when new users try
to sign up. I also need to go through methodically and make sure the game is
displaying sufficiently informative error messages when things go wrong.
I'd also like to add sound and the ability to customize player marks further.
